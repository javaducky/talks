# Embracing Disruption: Adding a Bit of Chaos To Help You Grow!

As software systems have become more distributed and complex, the "shift-left" movement brings reliability testing to earlier stages of development. Ensuring reliability goes beyond simple end-to-end tests. 

To ensure the highest levels of reliability, you must perform a suite of testing types. Incorporate contract tests to validate APIs; load tests for scaling predictability. But how to test for those inevitable failures? Let's learn from Chaos Engineering principles by incorporating disruptive behavior into your system _before_ production. 

Join Paul as we learn ways to incorporate a plethora of testing into your software development pipeline. We'll discuss the pros and cons of each and what you can do to add these to your processes. By embracing a little disruption, you can significantly improve the reliability of your system.
